# Linear Regression 3D
A visualization of Linear Regression with two input variables. Uses Raylib :)

### Quick Start
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

### Controls
WASD to fly around  
Mouse to look with the camera  
Left click grid to place a point  
Scroll Wheel to raise/lower point  

#### Note
Plane mesh is only viewable at the top, so if you cannot see the regression plane, then fly above the points. :)
